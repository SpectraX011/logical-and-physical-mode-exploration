# logical-and-physical-mode-exploration

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains resources and documentation focused on the exploration of **Logical** and **Physical** modes within networking environments. It specifically includes Packet Tracer labs designed to demonstrate how data flows through a network (Logical) versus how devices are physically cabled and located (Physical).

## 📂 Repository Contents
* **Packet Tracer Files**: Hands-on lab files (e.g., `1.0.5-packet-tracer---logical-and-physical-mode-exploration.pkt`) for network simulation.
* **Documentation**: Initial setup and guides for understanding the differences between logical and physical network topologies.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To view and interact with the lab files in this repository, you will need to have **Cisco Packet Tracer** installed on your machine.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/SpectraX011/logical-and-physical-mode-exploration.git

2. **Open the file:**
   Launch Cisco Packet Tracer and open the `.pkt` file located in the root directory.

## 🛠 Features Explored
* **Logical Mode:** Visualizing network layer connectivity, IP addressing, and data paths.
* **Physical Mode:** Arranging devices in wiring closets, cities, or buildings to reflect real-world hardware placement.
* **Network Troubleshooting:** Identifying connectivity issues across different simulation layers.
